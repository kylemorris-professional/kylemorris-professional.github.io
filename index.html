                I plan on opening up to clients for website development
                somewhere in the begining third quater of 2022. I hope to do
                this after the completion of a course in web development at
                vector tech about webdevelopment. Afer that point I hope to
                learn a web builder such as webflow or wordpress, to help in the
                website building process for those websites that don't need to
                be entirly coded by hand, while also having enugh expertise to
                build somthing from scratch if needed

                    raspberry pi, I bought one because of its utility and it has
                    helped me learn a lot, like some concepts of networking such
                    as how ip adresses work, the fact that there is a local
                    network(lan) and that there is a wider area network (wan)
                    and what that means and many other concepts
                </li>
                <li>
                    linux, I hope to learn more about this for applications in
                    cybersecurity or devops in the future of my career. I know
                    the basics of navigating the linux terminal currently, and
                    use the desktop distribution (Manjaro) on my home pc due to
                    linux's ability to revive old computers
